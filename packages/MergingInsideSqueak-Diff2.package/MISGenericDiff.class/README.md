A MISGenericDiff holds the general logic for diffing two files against each other. This includes calculating the longest common subsequence, indices where different and common character blocks start/end and character/line based diffing.  Instance Variables  file1:  <SequenceableCollection> One of the two files to compare.  file2:  <SequenceableCollection> The other of the files to compare.  file1EndingConflict:  <Index> The index of the last compared line in file1.  file2EndingConflict:  <Object> The index of the last compared line in file2.  lineBlock: <SequenceableCollection> Holding a subset of one line which is given in both files.
